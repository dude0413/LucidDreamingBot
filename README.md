# LucidDreamingBot
This bot will look for when Redditors ask certain, recurring questions when it comes to lucid dreaming and will answer a specfic paragraph to the post (RedditBot).
No copying please.
This was my first major Python project that I did completely on my own.

UPDATES:

v1.0: made the basic framework for the bot.

v1.1: added variables for some of the submissions arguments

v1.2: Condensed the code from 47 to 37 lines. Decreased a LOT of the if statements. The code is now well suited if I would like to add more post names, without adding a lot of code.

v1.3: added the "Has replied to: # posts"

v1.4: BIG UPDATE added it to where it you can enter questions you are looking for and the answers you want for each of the questions in a txt file called 'replies_to_reply'. You would seperate them by ';'. Removed the "Has replied to: # posts" feature. This update it x10 more easier to add more questions to look for, also a lot easier to answer. 

v1.5: Small update, included the number of #'s I have commented on, into each comment.

v1.6: Another small update, included adding 'This is a bot. Please contact /u/dude0413 for bugs or suggestions. Has replied to # posts' to every comment it makes. Added to where the info about the bot is on the next line. Not on the same line as the main answer. 

v1.7: added updates to where you it automatically sends me a text message every time the bot replies to a post (with Twilio Trail Account). 

v1.8 (Potential PLANS): I plan to add comments into the mix and maybe where you can downvote the comment to delete it.
