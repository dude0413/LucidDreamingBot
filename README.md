# LucidDreamingBot
This bot will look for when plebs ask if they had a lucid dream and will answer a specfic paragraph to the post (RedditBot).
No copying plez.

UPDATES:

v1.0: made bot

v1.1: added variables for some of the submissions arguments

v1.2: Condensed the code from 47 to 37 lines. Decreased a LOT of the if statements. The code is now well suited if I would like to add more post names, without adding a lot of code.
