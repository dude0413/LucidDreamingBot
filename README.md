# LucidDreamingBot
This bot will look for when plebs ask if they had a lucid dream and will answer a specfic paragraph to the post (RedditBot).
No copying plez.

UPDATES:

v1.0: made bot

v1.1: added variables for some of the submissions arguments

v1.2: Condensed the code from 47 to 37 lines. Decreased a LOT of the if statements. The code is now well suited if I would like to add more post names, without adding a lot of code.

v1.3: added the "Has replied to: # posts"

v1.4: added it to where it you can enter questions you are looking for and the answers you want for each of the questions in a txt file called 'replies_to_reply'. You would seperate them by ';'. Removed the "Has replied to: # posts" feature.

v1.5 (PLANS): Somehow integrating the # of posts into each answer. Intigrating comments into the mix too?
